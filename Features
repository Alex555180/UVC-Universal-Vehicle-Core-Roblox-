# 🌱 **For Beginners**
The **UVC Suite of Operations** was built with one mission in mind:  
**to help new Roblox developers learn, experiment, and create without fear.**

When you're just starting out, vehicle systems can feel overwhelming — wheels, constraints, hinge limits, suspension, scripts tied to specific parts, and dozens of things that break if you rename one object. UVC removes all of that complexity.

### **Here’s what makes UVC beginner‑friendly:**

### ✔ **Only two required parts**
You only need:
- **A Body** (any BasePart, any size)  
- **A VehicleSeat** (can be visible or invisible)

That’s it.  
No wheels.  
No constraints.  
No special names.  
No complicated setup.

If your model has those two things, **UVC_Core will drive it.**

---

### ✔ **You can customize anything**
Want a tiny hover‑brick?  
A giant truck?  
A sci‑fi bike?  
A blocky low‑poly car?  
A realistic mesh supercar?

UVC doesn’t care.  
It adapts to whatever you build.

---

### ✔ **You don’t need to understand physics yet**
UVC handles:
- acceleration  
- steering  
- rotation  
- flip correction  
- velocity  
- gyro stabilization  

You don’t need to write physics code.  
You don’t need to tune forces.  
You don’t need to understand Roblox constraints.

Just drop the script in and drive.

---

### ✔ **One settings file controls everything**
All the important values — speed, steering, acceleration, camera, drift — live in one clean module:

```
UVC_Settings
```

Beginners can tweak numbers and instantly see the results in‑game.  
It’s the perfect way to learn how vehicle behavior works.

---

### ✔ **You’re allowed to experiment**
UVC is designed so beginners can:
- break things safely  
- try new ideas  
- swap models  
- change sizes  
- move parts around  
- learn by doing  

The framework won’t punish you for being creative.

---

### ✔ **Open‑source means you’re not alone**
You can:
- read the code  
- learn from it  
- modify it  
- ask questions  
- contribute improvements  
- see how others use it  

UVC isn’t just a tool — it’s a starting point for your journey as a developer.
